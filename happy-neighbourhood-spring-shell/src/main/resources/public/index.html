<b> To test endpoints:</b><br>

Currently, two ways to do so : Using postman or manually with curl.<br><br>

<b> With postman:</b><br><br>

The repository contains a collection of endpoints that you can import on your Postman.<br>
All you need to do is import this file in your postman and edit the endpoints. Change <b>both</b> path and body to replace :
<br><br>
- {{member-uuid}} by the id of a member you create<br><br>
- {{item-uuid}} by the id of an item you created<br><br>

The collection can be found <a href="https://github.com/barsifedron/candid-cqrs/tree/master/happy-neighbourhood-spring-shell/candid-cqrs.postman_collection.json">here</a><br><br>

Postman is a really convenient utility and can be found here : https://www.postman.com/<br><br>


<b>Manually with curl :</b><br><br>

In the same manner as with the Postman method, you will need to replace the uuids fields based on what you create.<br>
The curl commands can be found <a href="https://github.com/barsifedron/candid-cqrs/tree/master/happy-neighbourhood-spring-shell/candid-cqrs-endpoints-samples-curl.txt">here</a> <br><br>
